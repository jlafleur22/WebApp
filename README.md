# Overview

I have never used node.js before, so I wanted to develop a webapp program that would implement databases.

This webapp is begun by installing all of the below programs, and then navigating to 

I am programming a survey style webapp that sorts user information into a database. The database should then be sorted to display certain user pieces of information to users.

# Web Pages

The webpages have links to go between them. They should dynamically display the past database entries, and update with new entries (showing only age and answer, not name) after the user completes the survey (WIP).

# Development Environment

For this project, I used node.js, version 18.12.1 LTS obtained from [https://nodejs.org/en/](https://nodejs.org/en/). I used [Visual Studio Code version 1.73](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for my IDE. I used the VSCode extensions [Debugger for Java](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-debug), [Extension Pack for Java](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack), [JavaScript (ES6) code snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=xabikos.JavaScriptSnippets), and [Intellicode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualStudioExptTeam.vscodeintellicode), and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) version 5.0 for the database. I used npm, the built in installer to install several packages, all on their most recent versions, including [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon?activeTab=readme), [lodash](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash), [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express), [ejs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ejs), and [mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose).

The majority of the program was built using html and JavaScript.
